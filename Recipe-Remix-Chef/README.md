## üöÄ Getting Started: The Easiest Way

This project includes an automatic setup script to make getting started simple, even for non-technical users.

### **Step 1: Get the Code**

First, get the project files onto your computer.

* **Clone with Git:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/knightsri/AI-Projects.git
    ```
* **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd AI-Projects/Recipe-Remix-Chef
    ```
    *(Note: The final folder name might be different in your repository)*

### **Step 2: Run the One-Time Setup**

This is the only setup you need to do. This script will create a virtual environment, install the necessary packages, and ask for your API key.

* **On macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 install.py
    ```
* **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python install.py
    ```
Follow the on-screen instructions. Once the setup is complete, you're ready to use the app.

### **Step 3: Run the App!**

To run the recipe generator, you need to first activate the environment that the setup script created.

* **On macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
* **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

Once the environment is active (you'll see `(venv)` in your terminal), run the main application:

```bash
python main.py
