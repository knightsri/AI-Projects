## üöÄ Getting Started: The Easiest Way

This project includes an automatic setup script to make getting started simple.

### **Step 1: Get the Code**

First, get the project files onto your computer.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/knightsri/AI-Projects.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd AI-Projects/Recipe-Remix-Chef
    ```
    *(Note: The final folder name might be different in your repository)*

### **Step 2: Get Your Google AI API Key**

This project uses the Google AI API, which requires a free API key.

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:** [**Click here to create your API key**](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2.  Click `Create API key in new project`.
3.  **Copy the key.** You will need to paste this during the setup in the next step.

### **Step 3: Run the One-Time Setup**

This script will create a virtual environment, install packages, and ask for the API key if it's not already configured.

* **On macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 install.py
    ```

* **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python install.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen instructions.

### **Step 4: Run the App!**

To run the recipe generator, you must first activate the environment that the setup script created.

1.  **Activate the Environment:**
    * **On macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *You'll know it worked when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.*

2.  **Run the Main Application:**
    Once the environment is active, run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The recipe will be printed directly in your terminal with color formatting.
