üöÄ Getting Started: The Easiest Way
This project includes an automatic setup script to make getting started simple, even for non-technical users.

Step 1: Get the Code

First, get the project files onto your computer.

Clone with Git:

git clone [https://github.com/knightsri/AI-Projects.git](https://github.com/knightsri/AI-Projects.git)

Navigate to the project folder:

cd AI-Projects/Recipe-Remix-Chef

(Note: The final folder name might be different in your repository)

Step 2: Get Your Google AI API Key

This project uses the Google AI API, which requires a free API key.

Go to Google AI Studio: Click here to create your API key

Click Create API key in new project.

Copy the key. It's a long string of letters and numbers. You will need to paste this during the setup in the next step.

Step 3: Run the One-Time Setup

This script will create a virtual environment, install packages, and ask for the API key you just created.

On macOS / Linux:

python3 install.py

On Windows:

python install.py

Follow the on-screen instructions, and paste your API key when prompted.

Step 4: Run the App!

To run the recipe generator, you need to first activate the environment that the setup script created.

On macOS / Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

Once the environment is active (you'll see (venv) in your terminal), run the main application:

python main.py
